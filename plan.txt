Heres the plan... 

Goal: 
    - I want to be able to display my location, heartrate, and health data on my website
    - I want it to update semi-frequently, at least in 30 minute intervals

Steps: 
    - Create the endpoint on website using flask
    - Parse the JSON package and create a storage method
        - This includes rolling files to limit file size
        - Create a archival process to a local machine after the "month file" is full
    - Display the location data on a map using a google maps api of some kind, probably using javascript
    - Make the map interactive to use a specific range of data
    - Deploy it to the web

Tasks: 

Make KML translator from CSV
    - Translate to Unix time, Zulu time
    - Make 4 individual year/month/week/day files
Make Summary File from KML File
