Heres the plan... 

Goal: 
    - I want to be able to display my location
    - I want it to update semi-frequently, at least in 30 minute intervals

Steps: 
    - --> DONE <-- Create the endpoint on website using flask 
    - --> DONE <-- Parse the JSON package and create a storage method 
        - This includes rolling files to limit file size
        - Create a archival process to a local machine after the "month file" is full
    - --> DONE <-- Display the location data on a map using a google maps api of some kind, probably using javascript
    - Make the map interactive to use a specific range of data
    - --> DONE <-- Deploy it to the web

Tasks: 

 --> DONE <-- Make KML translator from CSV
    - Translate to Unix time, Zulu time
    - Make 4 individual year/month/week/day files
==> NOT NEEDED <== Make Summary File from KML File


Iterations of point selection algorythm:

    1. Take every 20th point and make it a line
    2. If the distance between point 1 and 3 is less than point 1's reported accuracy, throw away point 2
    3. If the point has an accuracy of greater than 10, throw it out, along with technique two
        - Great results
